# compFlowTools
A library of compressible flow tools like area mach relation, mass flow function, isentropic relations, etc.
Originally developed during AAE 538 (Air-breathing propulsion) at Purdue University. Adapted over the duration of my graduate coursework including
ME 510 (Gas Dynamics), AAE 537 (Hypersonic propulsion), and AAE 539 (Rocket Propulsion).
